Here‚Äôs how to **create a deploy user** on Ubuntu (or Debian) safely and correctly:

---

## üõ† Steps to create `deploy` user

Run these commands as **root** or via a user with `sudo`:
### 1. Create user (with home directory and bash shell)
```bash

sudo adduser deploy
```

### 2. Give the user sudo privileges
```bash
sudo usermod -aG sudo deploy
```

### 3. (Optional but recommended) Add deploy to docker group so it can run docker without sudo
```bash
sudo usermod -aG docker deploy
```

### 4. Set up SSH key login (on your local machine)
 - Copy your public key to server:
```bash
ssh-copy-id deploy@your_server_ip
```
Yes, you can generate an SSH key pair without a passphrase. This is common for automation or when you prefer not to enter a passphrase each time you use the key. Here's how to do it:

---

### ‚úÖ Generate SSH Key Pair Without Passphrase

Run the following command:

```bash
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -f ~/.ssh/id_rsa -N ''
```

* `-t rsa`: Specifies the RSA algorithm.
* `-b 4096`: Sets the key length to 4096 bits for enhanced security.
* `-f ~/.ssh/id_rsa`: Defines the file path to save the private key.
* `-N ''`: Sets an empty passphrase (no passphrase).

This command will generate the key pair without prompting for a passphrase.

### üîê Is It Safe to Use a Key Without a Passphrase?

Using a key without a passphrase is acceptable in certain scenarios:

* **Automation**: For scripts or services that require SSH access without manual intervention.
* **Controlled Environments**: When the private key is stored securely and access is restricted.

However, be aware that if someone gains access to your private key file, they can authenticate as you without any additional security layer. Therefore, ensure the private key file is properly secured with appropriate file permissions and access controls.

---

### üìÅ Verify the Generated Keys

After running the command, verify that the keys were created:

```bash
ls -l ~/.ssh/id_rsa ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
```

You should see both the private (`id_rsa`) and public (`id_rsa.pub`) key files listed.


### 5. (Optional) Disable password login (only allow SSH key) ‚Äî edit /etc/ssh/sshd_config
 - Set PasswordAuthentication no
 - Ensure PubkeyAuthentication yes
Then reload SSH:
```bash

sudo systemctl reload sshd
```

---

## ‚úÖ After creation: verify

* SSH in using `deploy` account

* Test `sudo` works:

  ```bash
  sudo whoami
  ```

  should output `root`.

* Test Docker (if you added `deploy` to `docker` group):

  ```bash
  docker ps
  ```

If you tell me your Ubuntu version, I can give commands tailored to it.
