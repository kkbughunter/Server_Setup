## üìò Overview

This document provides instructions for installing and uninstalling **EMQX (v5.8.8)** on a Debian/Ubuntu-based system.
EMQX is a high-performance, scalable, and reliable MQTT broker for IoT and real-time messaging applications.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation Steps

### 1. Download and Install EMQX

Run the following command to automatically install **EMQX 5.8.8**:

```bash
curl -s https://assets.emqx.com/scripts/install-emqx-deb.sh | sudo bash
sudo apt-get install emqx
```

This script performs the following:

* Downloads and installs the **EMQX** package and dependencies.
* Creates a **new user and group** named `emqx` for running the service.
* Registers EMQX as a **systemd service**, ensuring it starts automatically on boot.

---

### 2. Verify Installation

After installation, verify that EMQX is installed and running:

```bash
sudo systemctl status emqx
```

You should see output indicating that the service is **active (running)**.

To check the EMQX version:

```bash
emqx ctl status
```

### 3. Start, Stop, and Restart EMQX

Use the following systemd commands to manage the EMQX service:

| Action                         | Command                       |
| ------------------------------ | ----------------------------- |
| **Start EMQX**                 | `sudo systemctl start emqx`   |
| **Stop EMQX**                  | `sudo systemctl stop emqx`    |
| **Restart EMQX**               | `sudo systemctl restart emqx` |

| **Disable auto-start on boot** | `sudo systemctl disable emqx` |

```bash
