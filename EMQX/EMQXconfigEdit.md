The output of your `find` command shows that EMQX is installed on your system, with relevant directories and files located in standard paths. Specifically, the configuration files you need for the MySQL authenticator in EMQX 5.8.8 are likely in `/etc/emqx`. Here’s how to proceed with configuring the MQTT authentication settings and where the Dashboard-enabled configuration will be stored:

### Key Findings from `find` Output
- **Configuration Directory**: `/etc/emqx` contains the configuration files, including `emqx.conf`, where the MySQL authenticator settings should be added.
- **EMQX Binary**: `/usr/bin/emqx` and `/usr/lib/emqx/bin/emqx` indicate the executable locations for running EMQX commands.
- **Other Directories**:
  - `/var/log/emqx`: Log files for debugging.
  - `/var/lib/emqx`: Data storage (e.g., Mnesia database for dynamic configs).
  - `/run/emqx`: Runtime files (e.g., PID files).
  - `/usr/lib/emqx`: EMQX installation directory with libraries and binaries.

### Where to Add the MySQL Authenticator Configuration
The MySQL authenticator configuration you provided should be added to `/etc/emqx/emqx.conf`, as this is the primary configuration file for EMQX 5.8.8. If you configure authentication via the EMQX Dashboard, the settings are also stored here or in an internal database (persisted to disk in `/etc/emqx` or `/var/lib/emqx`).

### Steps to Configure
1. **Edit `emqx.conf`**  
   - Navigate to the configuration directory:
     ```bash:disable-run
     cd /etc/emqx
     ```
   - Open `emqx.conf` in a text editor (e.g., `nano` or `vim`):
     ```bash
     nano emqx.conf
     ```
   - Locate or add the `authn` section. If it doesn’t exist, create it at the root level. Add your MySQL authenticator configuration:
     ```hocon
     authn {
       chains {
         mysql_auth {
           backend = "mysql"
           mechanism = "password_based"
           server = "127.0.0.1:3306"
           username = "root"
           database = "mqtt_user"
           password = ""
           pool_size = 8
           password_hash_algorithm {
             name = "sha256"
             salt_position = "suffix"
           }
           query = "SELECT password_hash, salt FROM mqtt_user where username = ${username} LIMIT 1"
           query_timeout = "5s"
         }
       }
     }
     ```
   - Save and exit the editor.

2. **Reload Configuration**  
   - Apply the changes without restarting EMQX:
     ```bash
     /usr/bin/emqx_ctl conf reload
     ```
   - Alternatively, restart EMQX to ensure the configuration is loaded:
     ```bash
     systemctl restart emqx
     ```
     Or, if not using systemd:
     ```bash
     /usr/bin/emqx stop
     /usr/bin/emqx start
     ```

3. **Dashboard Configuration Storage**  
   - If you configure the MySQL authenticator via the EMQX Dashboard (Access Control > Authentication > Create), the settings are:
     - Written to `/etc/emqx/emqx.conf` under the `authn` section (as shown above).
     - Persisted in the internal Mnesia database (`/var/lib/emqx`) for dynamic configuration, which syncs across cluster nodes if applicable.
   - To verify the configuration after using the Dashboard:
     ```bash
     cat /etc/emqx/emqx.conf
     ```
     Or check the running configuration:
     ```bash
     /usr/bin/emqx_ctl conf show authn
     ```

4. **Verify Configuration**  
   - Test the MySQL authenticator by connecting an MQTT client with credentials stored in your `mqtt_user` database.
   - Check logs for errors if the connection fails:
     ```bash
     cat /var/log/emqx/emqx.log
     ```

### Additional Notes
- **File Check**: Confirm `emqx.conf` exists:
  ```bash
  ls -l /etc/emqx
  ```
  If `emqx.conf` is missing, look for other `.conf` files (e.g., `emqx_authn.conf`) or create `emqx.conf` with the necessary settings.
- **Dashboard Sync**: Dashboard changes are immediately applied and persisted to `/etc/emqx/emqx.conf` or the Mnesia database. In a clustered setup, ensure all nodes reflect the changes (they should sync automatically).
- **Permissions**: Ensure the EMQX process has write access to `/etc/emqx` and `/var/lib/emqx`. Run commands as `root` or the EMQX user if needed:
  ```bash
  chown -R emqx:emqx /etc/emqx /var/lib/emqx
  ```
- **Debugging**: If the configuration doesn’t work, check `/var/log/emqx/emqx.log` for errors related to MySQL connection or query issues.

### If You Encounter Issues
- If `/etc/emqx/emqx.conf` doesn’t reflect Dashboard changes, check `/var/lib/emqx` for dynamic config files or consult the EMQX documentation for your version: [EMQX 5.8.8 Authentication](https://docs.emqx.com/en/emqx/latest/access-control/authn/mysql.html).
- Share the output of `ls -l /etc/emqx` or any error logs if you need further assistance.
